                <p class="intro-text">Over the last decade, I have led more than 100 evaluations of international development programs across 25+ countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Middle East. This work has supported more than 70 governmental and non-governmental organizations around the world, including USAID, The Millennium Challenge Corporation, The International Rescue Committee, BRAC, World Vision, Catholic Relief Services, Heifer International, Helvetas, Welthungerhilfe, and Water for People, among many others.</p>
                
                <p class="intro-text">Although my experience is largely in food and water security, I have evaluated projects focused on conflict mitigation, biodiversity conservation, climate resilience, tourism development, teacher training, and smartphone applications.</p>

As the project manager for this series of evaluations, I oversaw household baseline data collection for activities and geospatial/biophysical analysis for two USAID-funded activities. Responsibilities included quantitative survey design, data collection firm management, data quality assurance, data analysis, and report writing.</p>

The Integrated Natural Resource Management team conducted an independent performance evaluation of these activities as well as an assessment of the Joint Results Framework. As the project manager for this evaluation, I supported a complex field mission across the DRC and CAR, implemented data quality assurance measures throughout data collection and analysis, and assisted in writing the final evaluation report.</p>
